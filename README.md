## ✨ About The Project

**AI Assistant** is a multi-functional desktop assistant developed by [RiturajS12](https://github.com/RiturajS12). It leverages the power of modern AI to understand voice commands, perform web searches, generate images, automate tasks, and carry out natural human-like conversations.

This assistant uses a smart decision-making engine to route queries efficiently to the appropriate module — whether it's for chatting, searching, or creating AI images.
